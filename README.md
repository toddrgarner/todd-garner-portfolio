# Todd Garner's Portfolio

## My Story
My name is Todd Garner. I've been in the banking industry for for over 20 years. I decided to become a fullstack software engineer after being laid off from my previous employer. After developing a growing interest, I decided to take the UCLA bootcamp program to further my knowledge web develpoment. I spend many hours daily in the studio editing, so I knew this would be a great transition into this field.

As a beginning web developer, I want to learn how to develop a codebase that would allows the user to navigate the site for search engines with efficiency and ease. I've included a project I completed from a project at bootcamp with more definitely to come in the future.
